# CharCraft-A-Comprehensive-C-Style-String-Toolkit
This project implements C-style string manipulation, including comparison, assignment, distance calculation, sorting, and duplicate removal. It features dynamic memory management and file-based word processing, offering a comprehensive toolkit for efficient low-level string operations in C.

# CharCraft: A Comprehensive C-Style String Toolkit

CharCraft is a powerful C-style string manipulation toolkit that provides essential string handling functionalities. This project focuses on fundamental operations like string comparison, assignment, distance calculation, sorting, and duplicate removal, all implemented using efficient low-level techniques. It also includes dynamic memory management and file-based word processing to enhance versatility.

## Features

- **String Operations:**
  - Compare two strings lexicographically.
  - Assign one string to another.
  - Calculate the edit distance between two strings.

- **Sorting and Duplicate Removal:**
  - Insertion sort for string arrays.
  - Remove duplicate strings from an array.

- **Search Functionality:**
  - Find a string in an array and return its index or the closest match.

- **File Integration:**
  - Read words from a file and dynamically populate a word array.

- **Memory Management:**
  - Cleanly deallocate memory for dynamically allocated arrays.

## Implementation Details

This project emphasizes the use of:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Ensures efficient memory usage for handling strings and arrays.
- **Pointer Arithmetic:** Leverages pointers for optimal performance in string processing.
- **Recursion:** Implements recursive algorithms for edit distance calculation.
- **C-Style String Handling:** Works directly with null-terminated character arrays for low-level control.
